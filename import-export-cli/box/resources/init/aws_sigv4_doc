<h2>This API is secured using AWS signature version 4</h2> 

<h3>How AWS Signature Version 4 works</h3>

<ol>
    <li> Create a canonical request. </li>
    <li> Use the canonical request and additional metadata to create a string for signing. </li>
    <li> Derive a signing key from your AWS secret access key. Then use the signing key, and the string from the previous step, 
    to create a signature. </li>
    <li> Add the resulting signature to the HTTP request in a header or as a query string parameter. </li>
</ol>

<h5>Important</h5>

<p>
    When you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or one of the AWS SDKs to make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign 
    the requests for you with the security credentials you specify when you configure the tools. When you use these tools, you don't need to 
    learn how to sign requests yourself. However, when you manually create HTTP requests to access AWS services, you must sign requests that 
    require signing yourself.
</p>

<h5>Signing requests</h5>

<p>
    To sign a request, you first calculate a hash (digest) of the request. Then you use the hash value, some other information from the 
    request, and your secret access key to calculate another hash known as the signature. Then you add the signature to the request in one 
    of the following ways: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Using the HTTP Authorization header.</li>
    <li>Adding a query string value to the request. Because the signature is part of the URL in this case, this type of URL is called a 
    presigned URL.</li>
</ul>
